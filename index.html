          owning your experience, sharing your passion, and becoming part of a
          group that values the rich history of aviation. Whether you’re a
          seasoned aviator or just starting your journey, Crestwind Aviation
          Club offers you a unique opportunity to take control, both in the
          cockpit and beyond.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Own a Piece of Aviation History:</strong> Our club gives you
            the chance to fly and potentially own a share in one of the most
            legendary aircraft—the Cessna 172. Known for its reliability and
            timeless design, the Cessna 172 has trained generations of pilots
            and continues to be a beloved aircraft for both learning and
            leisure.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Co-own your plane:</strong> Owning a share of a plane will
            reduce costs and keep flying fun. Go where you want to while keeping
            your skills sharp. Learn how to become a great aviator with a sense
            of community and the resources you need. Fly at your own pace while
            making progress towards your goals!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Traditional Steam Gauge Aircraft:</strong> At Crestwind, we
            take pride in our vintage aircraft, equipped with traditional steam
            gauges. These planes offer a unique flying experience that’s both
            challenging and rewarding, perfect for pilots who appreciate the
            craftsmanship and legacy of classic aviation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Community of Like-Minded Pilots:</strong> Join a community
            of aviation enthusiasts who share your passion for flying. Our
            members are more than just pilots—they’re owners, mentors, and
            friends. Share your experiences, learn from others, and grow
            together in a supportive environment.

            you’re navigating through mountain passes or enjoying a scenic
            flight, our high wing planes offer an unbeatable perspective.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Affordable Aircraft Ownership:</strong> We believe that
            flying should be accessible. Our club structure is designed to make
            aircraft ownership affordable, allowing you to experience the joys
            of flying without the full financial burden of owning an aircraft
            outright.

        <p>
          Crestwind Aviation Club is not just about flying; it’s about taking
          charge of your aviation journey. We provide the aircraft, the
          resources, and the community, but the real value comes from what you
          bring to the table. Our members are go-getters—pilots who are ready to
          put in the effort, take on challenges, and earn their wings.

          <li>
            <strong>Self-Directed Learning:</strong> While we offer mentorship
            and guidance, much of your learning will be self-driven. If you’re
            motivated and committed, you’ll find that the sky’s the limit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Shared Ownership, Shared Responsibility:</strong> As a
            member, you’ll have the opportunity to own a share in one of our
            aircraft. This not only reduces your flying costs but also gives you
            a deeper connection to the plane you fly.
